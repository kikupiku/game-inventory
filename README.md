### GAME INVENTORY

This project is part of [the Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Node.js curriculum.

It is aimed at putting into practice newly gained knowledge about how node.js works. To do it, I used [mongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as a dabatase, [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) for storing images in the cloud, with [mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) model building, and [pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) for my templates. I applied REST principles in building the functionality.

Each model action (creating, updating, deleting) is requires a password.

The project has been deployed on Heroku and is available **[HERE](https://game-inventory-kikupiku.herokuapp.com/)**
